# Tasker: Real-World Engineering Stories

## What if your most complex business processes were as reliable as database transactions?

Every engineering team faces the same challenge: **multi-step workflows that break in production**. E-commerce checkouts, data pipelines, user onboarding flows, microservices coordination â€“ these critical processes fail unpredictably, sometimes untraceably, and create those dreaded 3 AM wake-up calls.

**Tasker transforms brittle processes into bulletproof workflows.**

## The Problem with Traditional Approaches

Most systems treat workflows as giant, all-or-nothing operations. When step 3 of 8 fails, you lose everything and start over. This fragility creates:

- **Monolithic procedures**: One failure kills the entire process
- **Manual state management**: Hand-coded retry logic and dependency tracking
- **No observability**: When things break, you're playing detective
- **Technical debt**: Each workflow becomes a custom solution

**The real issue?** Traditional approaches often assume perfect execution in an imperfect world. And usually not initially! It's just that things chain together over time and retryability and idempotency show up as a problem of structure.

## How Tasker Solves This

Tasker is a production-ready Rails engine that makes workflows reliable through three core principles:

### 1. **Declarative Configuration**

Define what should happen, not how it should happen:

```yaml
# config/tasker/tasks/ecommerce/order_processing.yaml
name: process_order
namespace_name: ecommerce
version: 1.0.0

step_templates:
  - name: validate_cart
    handler_class: Ecommerce::ValidateCartHandler
  - name: process_payment
    depends_on_step: validate_cart
    handler_class: Ecommerce::ProcessPaymentHandler
    default_retryable: true
  - name: send_confirmation
    depends_on_step: process_payment
    handler_class: Ecommerce::SendConfirmationHandler
```

### 2. **Atomic Step Execution**

Each step is isolated, retryable, and idempotent:

```ruby
class Ecommerce::ProcessPaymentHandler < Tasker::StepHandler::Base
  def process(task, sequence, step)
    payment_result = PaymentService.charge(
      amount: task.context['total_amount'],
      token: task.context['payment_token']
    )

    # Permanent failure - don't retry
    raise Tasker::PermanentError, "Card declined" if payment_result.declined?

    # Retryable failure - will retry with exponential backoff
    raise Tasker::RetryableError, "Gateway timeout" if payment_result.timeout?

    { payment_id: payment_result.id, status: 'charged' }
  end
end
```

### 3. **Seamless Observability**

React to any workflow event with your own logic:

```ruby
class OrderTrackingSubscriber < Tasker::Events::Subscribers::BaseSubscriber
  subscribe_to 'task.completed', 'step.failed'

  def handle_task_completed(event)
    return unless event[:task_name] == 'process_order'
    Analytics.track('order_completed', event[:context])
  end

  def handle_step_failed(event)
    if event[:step_name] == 'process_payment'
      SlackNotifier.urgent_alert(
        "Payment failure for order #{event[:context][:order_id]}: #{event[:error_message]}"
      )
    end
  end
end
```

## Real-World Impact

Teams using Tasker report transformational improvements:

### **Before Tasker**

- Checkout failures during peak traffic require hours of manual reconciliation
- 3 AM alerts when ETL pipelines fail mid-process
- Custom retry logic scattered across every workflow
- Zero visibility into why processes fail

### **After Tasker**

- **98% of transient failures** recover automatically
- **Sub-50ms workflow analysis** even for complex dependencies
- **56 built-in events** provide complete lifecycle visibility
- **Intelligent retries** handle different failure types appropriately

## What Makes This Possible

### **Rails Engine Architecture**

- **Seamless integration**: Mounts at `/tasker` in existing Rails apps
- **Zero architectural rewrites**: Enhances your existing code
- **Production-ready**: 1,692 passing tests, comprehensive documentation

### **High-Performance SQL Functions**

- **50-100x faster** than traditional view-based approaches
- **Enterprise scale**: Complex workflow analysis in milliseconds
- **Horizontal scaling**: Performance degrades gracefully under load

### **Event-Driven Design**

- **56 built-in events**: Complete workflow lifecycle tracking
- **OpenTelemetry integration**: Distributed tracing out of the box
- **Custom integrations**: React to any workflow event
