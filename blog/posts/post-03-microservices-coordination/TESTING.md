# Testing Chapter 3: Microservices Coordination Examples

This guide provides comprehensive testing scenarios for the microservices coordination patterns demonstrated in Chapter 3.

## üöÄ Quick Start Testing

```bash
# One-command setup with all services
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/chapter-3/setup.sh | bash

cd microservices-demo
docker-compose up -d

# Run quick test
./bin/test-registration
```

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### 1. **Happy Path - Full Registration Success**

**Test**: All services respond successfully

```bash
# Create a new user registration
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "sarah@example.com",
    "name": "Sarah Chen",
    "plan": "pro",
    "phone": "+1-555-0123"
  }'

# Expected: Task completes with all steps successful
# Response includes task_id for monitoring
```

**What to verify:**
- User created in UserService (port 3001)
- Billing profile created in BillingService (port 3002)
- Preferences initialized in PreferencesService (port 3003)
- Welcome email queued in NotificationService (port 3004)
- All steps show "complete" status

### 2. **Service Timeout - Billing Service Slow**

**Test**: Billing service responds slowly, triggering timeout

```bash
# Simulate slow billing service
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/admin/simulate/slowdown \
  -d '{"delay_seconds": 35}'

# Attempt registration
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "timeout.test@example.com",
    "name": "Timeout Test",
    "plan": "enterprise"
  }'

# Monitor the retry behavior
watch -n 1 curl http://localhost:3000/api/tasks/{TASK_ID}/status
```

**What to verify:**
- Initial billing step times out after 30 seconds
- Step enters retry with exponential backoff
- Other parallel steps (preferences) complete normally
- Eventually succeeds after billing service recovers

### 3. **Circuit Breaker - Service Completely Down**

**Test**: User service fails repeatedly, opening circuit breaker

```bash
# Take down user service
docker-compose stop user-service

# Attempt multiple registrations
for i in {1..6}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/register \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{
      \"email\": \"breaker.test${i}@example.com\",
      \"name\": \"Breaker Test ${i}\"
    }"
  sleep 2
done

# Check circuit breaker status
curl http://localhost:3000/api/circuit-breakers/status
```

**What to verify:**
- First 5 attempts fail with connection errors
- 6th attempt fails immediately with "Circuit breaker OPEN"
- No additional calls made to user service
- Circuit breaker reopens after 60 seconds

### 4. **Idempotency - Duplicate Registration**

**Test**: Same user registered twice

```bash
# First registration
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "duplicate@example.com",
    "name": "Duplicate Test",
    "plan": "free"
  }'

# Wait for completion
sleep 5

# Exact same registration again
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "duplicate@example.com",
    "name": "Duplicate Test",
    "plan": "free"
  }'
```

**What to verify:**
- Second registration completes successfully
- User creation step shows "already_exists" status
- No duplicate billing profiles created
- Both tasks complete without errors

### 5. **Partial Failure Recovery - Preferences Service Error**

**Test**: Preferences service returns 500 error intermittently

```bash
# Configure preferences service to fail 50% of requests
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/admin/simulate/errors \
  -d '{"error_rate": 0.5, "error_code": 500}'

# Register user
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "partial.failure@example.com",
    "name": "Partial Failure Test"
  }'

# Watch retries
watch -n 1 curl http://localhost:3000/api/tasks/{TASK_ID}/steps
```

**What to verify:**
- Preferences step fails initially
- Automatic retry with backoff
- Other steps continue independently
- Eventually succeeds within retry limit

### 6. **Rate Limiting - Notification Service**

**Test**: Notification service enforces rate limits

```bash
# Send 10 registrations rapidly
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/register \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{
      \"email\": \"ratelimit${i}@example.com\",
      \"name\": \"Rate Limit Test ${i}\"
    }" &
done

# Monitor notification steps
curl http://localhost:3000/api/tasks?filter=recent | jq '.[] | select(.namespace=="user_management")'
```

**What to verify:**
- First few notification steps succeed
- Later ones get 429 Rate Limited response
- Steps respect Retry-After header
- Backoff prevents thundering herd

### 7. **Service Degradation - Free Plan Resilience**

**Test**: Billing service down but free users continue

```bash
# Stop billing service
docker-compose stop billing-service

# Register free user
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "free.degraded@example.com",
    "name": "Free User Test",
    "plan": "free"
  }'

# Register paid user (should fail)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "paid.degraded@example.com",
    "name": "Paid User Test",
    "plan": "pro"
  }'
```

**What to verify:**
- Free user registration completes with degraded billing
- Paid user registration retries and eventually fails
- Graceful degradation for non-critical services

### 8. **Correlation Tracking - Distributed Debugging**

**Test**: Track request across all services

```bash
# Register with explicit correlation ID
CORRELATION_ID="debug_test_$(date +%s)"

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"email\": \"correlation@example.com\",
    \"name\": \"Correlation Test\",
    \"correlation_id\": \"${CORRELATION_ID}\"
  }"

# Search logs across all services
docker-compose logs | grep $CORRELATION_ID

# Check service dashboards
open http://localhost:3000/correlation-trace/$CORRELATION_ID
```

**What to verify:**
- Correlation ID appears in all service logs
- Can trace entire request flow
- Service timings are recorded
- Easy to identify failure points

### 9. **Parallel Execution - Performance Testing**

**Test**: Verify parallel steps execute simultaneously

```bash
# Add artificial delays to services
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/admin/simulate/slowdown -d '{"delay_seconds": 5}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/admin/simulate/slowdown -d '{"delay_seconds": 5}'

# Time registration
time curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "parallel@example.com",
    "name": "Parallel Test"
  }'
```

**What to verify:**
- Total time ~5-6 seconds (not 10+)
- Billing and preferences run in parallel
- Step timings show overlap
- Parallel savings recorded in annotations

### 10. **Peak Hours Simulation - Adaptive Timeouts**

**Test**: System adapts during high load

```bash
# Simulate peak hours
export SIMULATE_PEAK_HOURS=true

# Generate load
./bin/load-test --users 100 --duration 60s

# Monitor timeout adjustments
curl http://localhost:3000/api/metrics | grep timeout
```

**What to verify:**
- Timeouts increase during peak hours
- Backoff periods extended
- System remains stable under load
- Gradual recovery after peak

## üîç Monitoring and Debugging

### Check Service Health
```bash
# Overall system health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Individual service health
curl http://localhost:3001/health  # User Service
curl http://localhost:3002/health  # Billing Service
curl http://localhost:3003/health  # Preferences Service
curl http://localhost:3004/health  # Notification Service

# Circuit breaker status
curl http://localhost:3000/api/circuit-breakers/status
```

### View Distributed Traces
```bash
# If using Jaeger (with observability setup)
open http://localhost:16686

# Search by correlation ID or service name
```

### Database Inspection
```bash
# Check task states
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U tasker -c "
  SELECT t.id, t.status, t.created_at,
         COUNT(CASE WHEN ws.status = 'complete' THEN 1 END) as completed_steps,
         COUNT(ws.id) as total_steps
  FROM tasker_tasks t
  LEFT JOIN tasker_workflow_steps ws ON ws.task_id = t.id
  WHERE t.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
  GROUP BY t.id
  ORDER BY t.created_at DESC
  LIMIT 10;
"
```

## üêõ Common Issues and Solutions

### "Circuit breaker is OPEN"
**Problem**: Service has failed too many times
**Solution**: 
- Wait for recovery timeout (60 seconds)
- Check service health: `docker-compose ps`
- Reset circuit breaker: `curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/circuit-breakers/reset`

### "Task stuck in pending"
**Problem**: No workers processing tasks
**Solution**:
- Check Sidekiq: `docker-compose logs sidekiq`
- Ensure Redis is running: `docker-compose ps redis`
- Restart workers: `docker-compose restart sidekiq`

### "All services timeout"
**Problem**: Network issues or resource constraints
**Solution**:
- Check Docker resources: `docker stats`
- Increase Docker memory allocation
- Check for port conflicts: `lsof -i :3001-3004`

### "Correlation ID not propagating"
**Problem**: Services not forwarding headers
**Solution**:
- Check service logs for X-Correlation-ID header
- Verify middleware is installed in each service
- Update service configuration
