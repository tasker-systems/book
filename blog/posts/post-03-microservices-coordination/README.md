# Chapter 3: Microservices Coordination

> **Orchestrate service dependencies without the chaos**

## 🎭 The Story

*"You've broken your monolith into 12 microservices. Congratulations! Now simple user registration involves 6 API calls across 4 services. What could go wrong?"*

Sarah's team at GrowthCorp faced this exact nightmare after their microservices migration. This chapter shows how they transformed distributed chaos into coordinated workflows using Tasker's sophisticated orchestration capabilities.

## 🚀 What You'll Learn

### **Service Orchestration Patterns**
- **API step handlers** extending `Tasker::StepHandler::Api`
- **Correlation ID tracking** for distributed debugging
- **Graceful degradation** when services are unavailable
- **Idempotent operations** across service boundaries

### **The Circuit Breaker Revelation**
- **Why Tasker's SQL-driven architecture beats in-memory circuit breakers**
- **How typed errors (`RetryableError` vs `PermanentError`) create intelligent retry logic**
- **Distributed coordination through persistent database state**
- **Rich observability via SQL queries and structured logging**

## 📖 Chapter Contents

- **[Read the Blog Post](blog-post.md)** - The full narrative with code examples
- **[Code Examples](code-examples/)** - Complete working implementation
- **[Setup Scripts](setup-scripts/)** - One-command demo setup (Docker support coming soon)
- **[Testing Guide](TESTING.md)** - How to validate the examples

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **Leverage framework capabilities** - Don't re-implement what Tasker already provides better
2. **Use typed error handling** - Let the framework manage circuit breaker logic
3. **Design for idempotency** - Critical for distributed service coordination
4. **Embrace SQL-driven orchestration** - More durable than in-memory patterns
