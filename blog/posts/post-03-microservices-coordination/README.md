# Chapter 3: Microservices Coordination

> **Coming Soon**: Orchestrate service dependencies without the chaos

## ðŸŽ­ The Story Preview

*"You've broken your monolith into 12 microservices. Congratulations! Now simple user registration involves 6 API calls across 4 services. What could go wrong?"*

This chapter tackles the coordination nightmare that many teams face after microservices adoption:
- **Cascade failures** from service dependencies
- **Timeout and retry chaos** across service boundaries
- **Debugging hell** when workflows span multiple services
- **Inconsistent patterns** for error handling and recovery

## ðŸš€ What You'll Learn

### **Service Orchestration Patterns**
- **API step handlers** with built-in circuit breakers
- **Timeout management** across service boundaries
- **Correlation ID tracking** for distributed debugging
- **Graceful degradation** when services are unavailable

### **Resilience Engineering**
- **Circuit breaker patterns** to prevent cascade failures
- **Bulkhead isolation** for service independence
- **Retry strategies** adapted to service characteristics
- **Fallback mechanisms** for critical user journeys

## ðŸ“… Target Release
**Q2 2024** - Full chapter with working examples
