# Building Workflows That Scale With Your Team

*How one company solved the namespace wars and workflow chaos that come with rapid growth*

---

## The Growing Pains Crisis

One year after mastering microservices orchestration, GrowthCorp was living up to its name. The engineering team had grown from 12 to 85 people across 8 specialized domain teams.

Each team was building workflows. Lots of workflows.

The trouble started during a routine deploy on a Tuesday morning. Jake from the Payments team pushed his new refund processing workflow to production. Within minutes, the Customer Success team's refund escalation workflow started failing.

"Wait," said Priya from Customer Success during the emergency Slack call. "You guys have a `ProcessRefund` workflow too? Ours has been running for months!"

"We've had `ProcessRefund` since the beginning," replied Jake. "It handles payment gateway refunds."

Sarah, now the VP of Engineering, felt a familiar sinking feeling. They had hit the wall that every scaling engineering organization faces: **namespace hell**.

## The Namespace Wars

Here's what their workflow collision looked like:

```ruby
# Payments Team's workflow
class ProcessRefundHandler < Tasker::TaskHandler::Base
  TASK_NAME = 'process_refund'  # ❌ Collision!
  VERSION = '1.0.0'
  
  # Handles payment gateway refunds
end

# Customer Success Team's workflow  
class ProcessRefundHandler < Tasker::TaskHandler::Base
  TASK_NAME = 'process_refund'  # ❌ Same name!
  VERSION = '1.0.0'
  
  # Handles customer service refunds with approvals
end
```

When both workflows registered with the name `process_refund`, the last one loaded would overwrite the first. Deployments became a game of Russian roulette.

The chaos multiplied across teams with conflicting names for `ProcessReturn`, `GenerateReport`, `DeployService`, and `SendNotification`.

## The Governance Nightmare

Sarah's first instinct was to create a governance process:

> **New Rule**: All workflow names must be approved by the Architecture Committee

This "solution" created more problems:
- Development velocity slowed as teams waited for name approvals
- Bike-shedding discussions about naming conventions
- Creative workarounds like `ProcessRefundV2`, `ProcessRefundReal`

Three months later, they had 47 different variations of "process refund" workflows, and the Architecture Committee was spending 6 hours per week in naming meetings.

## The Namespace Solution

After studying how other large engineering organizations solved this problem, Sarah's team implemented Tasker's namespace and versioning system:

```ruby
# Payments Team's workflow - properly namespaced
module Payments
  class ProcessRefundHandler < Tasker::TaskHandler::Base
    TASK_NAME = 'process_refund'
    NAMESPACE = 'payments'          # ✅ Clear ownership
    VERSION = '2.1.0'              # ✅ Semantic versioning
    
    register_handler(TASK_NAME, namespace_name: NAMESPACE, version: VERSION)
    
    define_step_templates do |templates|
      templates.define(
        name: 'validate_payment_eligibility',
        description: 'Check if payment can be refunded via gateway'
      )
      templates.define(
        name: 'process_gateway_refund',
        description: 'Execute refund through payment processor',
        depends_on_step: 'validate_payment_eligibility'
      )
      templates.define(
        name: 'update_payment_records',
        description: 'Update internal payment status and history',
        depends_on_step: 'process_gateway_refund'
      )
      templates.define(
        name: 'notify_customer',
        description: 'Send refund confirmation to customer',
        depends_on_step: 'update_payment_records'
      )
    end
  end
end

# Customer Success Team's workflow - different namespace
module CustomerSuccess
  class ProcessRefundHandler < Tasker::TaskHandler::Base
    TASK_NAME = 'process_refund'
    NAMESPACE = 'customer_success'  # ✅ Different namespace
    VERSION = '1.3.0'
    
    register_handler(TASK_NAME, namespace_name: NAMESPACE, version: VERSION)
    
    define_step_templates do |templates|
      templates.define(
        name: 'validate_refund_request',
        description: 'Validate customer refund request details'
      )
      templates.define(
        name: 'check_refund_policy',
        description: 'Verify request complies with refund policies',
        depends_on_step: 'validate_refund_request'
      )
      templates.define(
        name: 'get_manager_approval',
        description: 'Route to manager for approval if needed',
        depends_on_step: 'check_refund_policy'
      )
      templates.define(
        name: 'execute_refund_workflow',
        description: 'Call payments team refund workflow',
        depends_on_step: 'get_manager_approval'
      )
    end
  end
end
```

Now teams could use the same logical names without conflicts:

```ruby
# Payments team creates a refund
payments_refund = Tasker::Types::TaskRequest.new(
  name: 'process_refund',
  namespace: 'payments',
  version: '2.1.0',
  context: { payment_id: 'pay_123', amount: 49.99 }
)

# Customer Success team creates a different refund
cs_refund = Tasker::Types::TaskRequest.new(
  name: 'process_refund',
  namespace: 'customer_success', 
  version: '1.3.0',
  context: { ticket_id: 'cs_456', customer_id: 'cust_789' }
)

# Both workflows coexist peacefully
payments_task = Tasker::TaskExecutor.execute_async(payments_refund)
cs_task = Tasker::TaskExecutor.execute_async(cs_refund)
```

## Team Workflow Organization

The namespace system enabled each team to organize their workflows logically:

```
# Payments namespace
payments/
├── process_refund (v2.1.0)
├── process_payment (v3.0.0)  
├── handle_chargeback (v1.2.0)
├── reconcile_transactions (v1.1.0)
└── generate_payment_report (v2.0.0)

# Customer Success namespace
customer_success/
├── process_refund (v1.3.0)
├── escalate_ticket (v2.2.0)
├── generate_satisfaction_survey (v1.0.0)
├── process_cancellation (v1.1.0)
└── generate_support_report (v1.5.0)

# Inventory namespace
inventory/
├── process_return (v1.4.0)
├── update_stock_levels (v2.3.0)
├── reorder_products (v1.8.0)
├── process_warehouse_transfer (v1.0.0)
└── generate_inventory_report (v2.1.0)
```

## Version Coexistence Strategy

The breakthrough came when they realized they needed to run multiple versions simultaneously during transitions:

```ruby
# app/tasks/payments/process_refund_handler.rb
module Payments
  class ProcessRefundHandler < Tasker::TaskHandler::Base
    TASK_NAME = 'process_refund'
    NAMESPACE = 'payments'
    VERSION = '2.1.0'  # New version with fraud detection
    
    register_handler(TASK_NAME, namespace_name: NAMESPACE, version: VERSION)
    
    define_step_templates do |templates|
      templates.define(
        name: 'validate_payment_eligibility',
        description: 'Check payment refund eligibility'
      )
      templates.define(
        name: 'check_fraud_indicators',  # ✅ New step in v2.1.0
        description: 'Screen for potential fraud before refunding',
        depends_on_step: 'validate_payment_eligibility'
      )
      templates.define(
        name: 'process_gateway_refund',
        description: 'Execute refund through payment processor',
        depends_on_step: 'check_fraud_indicators'
      )
      templates.define(
        name: 'update_payment_records',
        description: 'Update payment status and history',
        depends_on_step: 'process_gateway_refund'
      )
      templates.define(
        name: 'notify_stakeholders',  # ✅ Enhanced notifications in v2.1.0
        description: 'Notify customer and internal teams',
        depends_on_step: 'update_payment_records'
      )
    end
  end
end
```

This allowed gradual migrations:

```ruby
# New refunds use v2.1.0 with fraud detection
new_refund = Tasker::Types::TaskRequest.new(
  name: 'process_refund',
  namespace: 'payments',
  version: '2.1.0',  # Latest version
  context: { payment_id: 'pay_new_123' }
)

# Legacy systems can still use v2.0.0 during transition
legacy_refund = Tasker::Types::TaskRequest.new(
  name: 'process_refund', 
  namespace: 'payments',
  version: '2.0.0',  # Older version during migration
  context: { payment_id: 'pay_legacy_456' }
)
```

## Workflow Discovery and Governance

With namespaces organized, they built automatic workflow discovery and lightweight governance:

```ruby
# Team ownership and policies
Tasker.configuration do |config|
  config.namespace_policies do |policies|
    # Each team owns their namespace
    policies.define_namespace('payments') do |ns|
      ns.owner_team = 'payments'
      ns.contact_email = 'payments-team@growthcorp.com'
      ns.description = 'Payment processing, refunds, and financial workflows'
      ns.requires_approval = false  # Team has full autonomy
    end
    
    policies.define_namespace('customer_success') do |ns|
      ns.owner_team = 'customer_success'
      ns.contact_email = 'cs-team@growthcorp.com'
      ns.description = 'Customer support and success workflows'
      ns.requires_approval = false
    end
    
    # Shared namespaces require approval
    policies.define_namespace('shared') do |ns|
      ns.owner_team = 'platform'
      ns.contact_email = 'platform-team@growthcorp.com'
      ns.description = 'Cross-team workflows and utilities'
      ns.requires_approval = true
      ns.approvers = ['sarah@growthcorp.com', 'marcus@growthcorp.com']
    end
  end
end
```

## Cross-Team Workflow Collaboration

The real breakthrough came when teams needed to coordinate workflows across namespaces:

```ruby
# Customer Success workflow that calls Payments workflow
module CustomerSuccess
  class ProcessRefundHandler < Tasker::TaskHandler::Base
    TASK_NAME = 'process_refund'
    NAMESPACE = 'customer_success'
    VERSION = '1.3.0'
    
    register_handler(TASK_NAME, namespace_name: NAMESPACE, version: VERSION)
    
    define_step_templates do |templates|
      templates.define(
        name: 'validate_refund_request',
        description: 'Validate customer refund request'
      )
      
      templates.define(
        name: 'get_manager_approval',
        description: 'Get manager approval for refund',
        depends_on_step: 'validate_refund_request'
      )
      
      # Cross-namespace workflow invocation
      templates.define(
        name: 'execute_payment_refund',
        description: 'Execute refund via payments team workflow',
        depends_on_step: 'get_manager_approval',
        handler_class: 'CustomerSuccess::StepHandlers::ExecutePaymentRefundHandler'
      )
      
      templates.define(
        name: 'update_customer_record',
        description: 'Update customer service records',
        depends_on_step: 'execute_payment_refund'
      )
    end
  end
end

# Cross-namespace step handler
module CustomerSuccess
  module StepHandlers
    class ExecutePaymentRefundHandler < Tasker::StepHandler::Base
      def process(task, sequence, step)
        refund_approval = step_results(sequence, 'get_manager_approval')
        
        # Create a payments workflow request
        payments_request = Tasker::Types::TaskRequest.new(
          name: 'process_refund',
          namespace: 'payments',        # ✅ Different namespace
          version: '2.1.0',           # ✅ Specific version
          context: {
            payment_id: refund_approval['payment_id'],
            amount: refund_approval['approved_amount'],
            reason: 'customer_service_refund',
            initiated_by: 'customer_success',
            cs_ticket_id: task.context['ticket_id']
          }
        )
        
        # Execute the payments workflow
        payments_task = Tasker::TaskExecutor.execute_sync(payments_request)
        
        case payments_task.status
        when 'completed'
          payment_result = payments_task.workflow_steps
            .find { |step| step.name == 'process_gateway_refund' }
            .result
            
          {
            payment_refund_id: payment_result['refund_id'],
            refund_amount: payment_result['amount'],
            refunded_at: payment_result['processed_at'],
            payments_task_id: payments_task.id
          }
        when 'failed'
          raise Tasker::RetryableError, "Payment refund failed: #{payments_task.error_summary}"
        else
          raise Tasker::RetryableError, "Payment refund in unexpected state: #{payments_task.status}"
        end
      end
      
      private
      
      def step_results(sequence, step_name)
        step = sequence.steps.find { |s| s.name == step_name }
        step&.result || {}
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## The Results

**Before Namespaces:**
- 47 different variations of common workflow names
- Weekly deployment conflicts between teams
- 6 hours per week spent in Architecture Committee naming meetings
- Silent failures when wrong workflows triggered
- Teams couldn't iterate independently

**After Namespaces:**
- Zero naming conflicts between teams
- Independent deployment cycles for each team
- Zero Architecture Committee meetings about naming
- Clear ownership and discovery of all workflows
- Teams can evolve workflows independently while collaborating across boundaries

The namespace system didn't just solve their technical problems - it solved their organizational problems.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Namespace by team ownership** - Each team should own their workflow namespace completely

2. **Version for gradual migrations** - Multiple versions enable safe transitions without breaking existing flows

3. **Build discovery, not governance** - Make workflows discoverable rather than adding approval overhead

4. **Enable cross-team collaboration** - Teams should be able to invoke each other's workflows cleanly

5. **Think organization, not just code** - Scaling challenges are often people problems that need technical solutions

6. **Automate policy enforcement** - Lightweight automated policies work better than heavyweight manual processes
