# Preview: The Data Pipeline That Kept Everyone Awake

*Full chapter coming Q1 2024*

## The 3 AM Alert

Sarah's phone buzzes at 3:17 AM. Again.

> **DataOps Alert**: Customer analytics pipeline failed  
> **Impact**: No dashboard data for morning executive meeting  
> **ETA**: Manual intervention required

She's the third engineer this month to be woken up by the same pipeline. It's becoming a joke in the team chat: "Who's turn is it to debug the nightly ETL?"

But it's not funny when you're the one staring at logs at 3 AM, trying to figure out which of the 47 interdependent data processing steps failed, and whether you need to reprocess 6 hours worth of customer transaction data.

## The Problem

Data pipelines are different from other workflows. They're:
- **Long-running** (hours, not seconds)
- **Resource-intensive** (gigabytes, not kilobytes)
- **Interdependent** (step N+5 depends on steps N, N+1, N+2)
- **Time-sensitive** (business SLAs depend on fresh data)

When they fail, the impact cascades:
- **Dashboards show stale data**
- **Business decisions are delayed**
- **Engineering time is consumed by manual intervention**
- **Data quality degrades over time**

## The Tasker Solution Preview

Transform your fragile ETL nightmare into a resilient, observable data workflow:

```ruby
class CustomerAnalyticsHandler < Tasker::TaskHandler::Base
  define_step_templates do |templates|
    # Parallel data extraction (3 concurrent operations)
    templates.define(
      name: 'extract_orders',
      handler_class: 'DataPipeline::ExtractOrdersHandler'
    )
    templates.define(
      name: 'extract_users',
      handler_class: 'DataPipeline::ExtractUsersHandler'  
    )
    templates.define(
      name: 'extract_products',
      handler_class: 'DataPipeline::ExtractProductsHandler'
    )
    
    # Dependent transformation (waits for all extractions)
    templates.define(
      name: 'transform_customer_metrics',
      depends_on_step: ['extract_orders', 'extract_users', 'extract_products'],
      handler_class: 'DataPipeline::TransformMetricsHandler'
    )
    
    # Quality gates and final output
    templates.define(
      name: 'validate_data_quality',
      depends_on_step: 'transform_customer_metrics',
      handler_class: 'DataPipeline::ValidateQualityHandler'
    )
  end
end
```

## What's Coming

**The complete chapter will cover:**

### **Parallel Processing Patterns**
- Fan-out/fan-in workflow design
- Resource management for concurrent operations
- Dependency coordination across multiple data sources

### **Progress Tracking & Monitoring**
- Real-time progress updates for long-running operations
- Smart alerting that distinguishes critical from routine failures
- Dashboard integration for operational visibility

### **Data-Specific Recovery Strategies**
- Checkpoint and resume for large dataset processing
- Incremental updates to avoid full reprocessing
- Data quality gates with automatic rollback

### **Event-Driven Operations**
- Slack notifications that adapt to failure severity
- Automatic retry strategies based on data characteristics
- Integration with existing monitoring infrastructure
