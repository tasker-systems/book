# Chapter 2: Data Pipeline Resilience

> **Coming Soon**: Transform fragile ETL nightmares into reliable, observable data workflows

## üé≠ The Story Preview

*"Your data science team needs fresh customer analytics every morning at 6 AM. The ETL pipeline runs overnight, processing millions of records. When it breaks at 3 AM, everyone's day starts badly."*

Sound familiar? This chapter shows how to build ETL workflows that handle:
- **Partial failures** without reprocessing entire datasets
- **Complex dependencies** between data transformations
- **Progress tracking** for long-running operations
- **Event-driven monitoring** with smart alerting

## üöÄ What You'll Learn

Building on Chapter 1's foundations, this chapter introduces:

### **Advanced Workflow Patterns**
- **Parallel execution** for independent operations
- **Fan-out/fan-in** patterns for data processing
- **Conditional branching** based on data characteristics
- **Checkpoint and resume** for large dataset processing

### **Event-Driven Architecture**
- **Workflow monitoring** with real-time notifications
- **Progress tracking** with completion estimates
- **Smart alerting** that reduces noise
- **Dashboard integration** for operational visibility

### **Data-Specific Patterns**
- **Chunked processing** for memory management
- **Incremental updates** to avoid full reprocessing
- **Data quality gates** with validation workflows
- **Rollback strategies** for data corruption scenarios

## üìä Expected Results

Based on real implementations, this chapter demonstrates:

| Challenge | Before Tasker | After Tasker |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Pipeline failures** | 3 AM manual intervention | Automatic retry and recovery |
| **Partial failures** | Reprocess entire dataset | Resume from failure point |
| **Debugging time** | Hours of log diving | Minutes with workflow visibility |
| **Data freshness** | Delayed by manual fixes | Consistent on-time delivery |

## üõ†Ô∏è Planned Examples

### **Customer Analytics Pipeline**
```ruby
class CustomerAnalyticsHandler < Tasker::TaskHandler::Base
  define_step_templates do |templates|
    # Parallel data extraction
    templates.define(name: 'extract_orders')
    templates.define(name: 'extract_users')
    templates.define(name: 'extract_products')

    # Dependent transformations
    templates.define(
      name: 'transform_customer_metrics',
      depends_on_step: ['extract_orders', 'extract_users']
    )

    # Event-driven monitoring
    templates.define(
      name: 'validate_data_quality',
      depends_on_step: 'transform_customer_metrics'
    )
  end
end
```

### **Real-Time Monitoring**
```ruby
class DataPipelineMonitor < Tasker::EventSubscriber::Base
  subscribe_to 'step.failed', 'task.completed', 'data.quality_check_failed'

  def handle_step_failed(event)
    if critical_step?(event[:step_name])
      SlackAPI.post_message(
        channel: '#data-engineering',
        text: "üö® Critical pipeline failure: #{event[:step_name]}"
      )
    end
  end
end
```

## üí° Preview: Key Concepts

### **Parallel Execution**
Unlike sequential workflows, data pipelines often need to process independent operations simultaneously:

```ruby
# Multiple extractions run in parallel
templates.define(name: 'extract_orders')    # Runs immediately
templates.define(name: 'extract_users')     # Runs immediately
templates.define(name: 'extract_products')  # Runs immediately

# Transformation waits for all extractions
templates.define(
  name: 'transform_data',
  depends_on_step: ['extract_orders', 'extract_users', 'extract_products']
)
```

### **Progress Tracking**
Long-running data operations need visibility into their progress:

```ruby
def process(task, sequence, step)
  total_records = count_records_to_process
  processed = 0

  process_in_batches do |batch|
    process_batch(batch)
    processed += batch.size

    # Update progress for monitoring
    update_progress(processed, total_records)
  end
end
```

### **Event-Driven Monitoring**
Smart alerting that adapts to data pipeline characteristics:

```ruby
def handle_step_failed(event)
  case event[:step_name]
  when 'extract_orders'
    # Data source issue - page immediately
    page_on_call_engineer(event)
  when 'generate_summary_report'
    # Non-critical - can wait until business hours
    schedule_notification(event, delay: 4.hours)
  end
end
```
