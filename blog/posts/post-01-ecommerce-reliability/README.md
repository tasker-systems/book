## 🎯 Blog Post Objectives

**Problem Focus**: Checkout reliability and failure recovery  
**Target Audience**: Backend engineers dealing with fragile e-commerce flows  
**Tasker Features Introduced**:
- Basic task and step creation
- Dependency management
- Retry logic and error handling
- State management and recovery
- Workflow visibility and debugging

## 🚀 Quick Demo

Want to see this in action? Here's the 5-minute setup:

```bash
# 1. Create a new Rails app (if needed)
rails new tasker_ecommerce_demo --database=postgresql
cd tasker_ecommerce_demo

# 2. Add Tasker to Gemfile
echo 'gem "tasker", "~> 2.5.0"' >> Gemfile
bundle install

# 3. Copy our setup script and run it
curl -o setup.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/tasker-blog/main/post-01-ecommerce-reliability/setup-scripts/setup.sh
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# 4. Start the demo
rails server
bundle exec sidekiq  # In another terminal

# 5. Test a checkout
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/checkout \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "checkout": {
      "cart_items": [{"product_id": 1, "quantity": 2}],
      "payment_info": {"token": "test_success_visa", "amount": 100.00},
      "customer_info": {"email": "test@example.com", "name": "Test Customer"}
    }
  }'
```

## 📚 Key Code Examples

### The Problem: Fragile Monolithic Checkout

```ruby
# Before: Everything fails together
def process_order(cart_items, payment_info, customer_info)
  validated_items = validate_cart_items(cart_items)
  totals = calculate_order_totals(validated_items)
  payment_result = PaymentProcessor.charge(amount: totals[:total], payment_method: payment_info)
  update_inventory_levels(validated_items)
  order = Order.create!(items: validated_items, total: totals[:total], payment_id: payment_result.id)
  OrderMailer.confirmation_email(order).deliver_now
  order
rescue => e
  # What do we do here? Payment might be charged...
  logger.error "Checkout failed: #{e.message}"
  raise
end
```

### The Solution: Reliable Workflow Steps

```ruby
# After: Each step is atomic, retryable, and recoverable
class OrderProcessingHandler < Tasker::TaskHandler::Base
  define_step_templates do |templates|
    templates.define(
      name: 'validate_cart',
      retryable: true,
      retry_limit: 3
    )
    templates.define(
      name: 'process_payment',
      depends_on_step: 'validate_cart',
      retryable: true,
      retry_limit: 3,
      timeout: 30.seconds
    )
    templates.define(
      name: 'create_order',
      depends_on_step: 'process_payment'
    )
    templates.define(
      name: 'send_confirmation',
      depends_on_step: 'create_order',
      retryable: true,
      retry_limit: 5
    )
  end
end
```

## 🔧 What Makes This Reliable

### 1. Atomic Steps with Clear Dependencies
- Each step does one thing and does it well
- Dependencies ensure correct execution order
- Failed steps don't affect completed ones

### 2. Intelligent Retry Logic
- Different retry strategies for different error types
- Exponential backoff prevents service overload
- Non-retryable errors fail fast

### 3. Complete State Management
- Know exactly where failures occurred
- Resume from failure point, not from beginning
- Full audit trail of all attempts

### 4. Built-in Observability
- Real-time workflow status
- Step-by-step execution details
- Error context for debugging

## 🎓 Learning Path

This blog post introduces foundational concepts that build toward more advanced topics:

1. **Next: Data Pipelines** - Parallel execution and event monitoring
2. **Then: Microservices** - API integration and circuit breakers  
3. **Later: Enterprise** - Namespaces, versioning, security

## 📊 Results Comparison

| Metric | Before Tasker | After Tasker |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Checkout failure rate | 15% during peak | 0.2% |
| Manual recovery time | 6 hours | 0 (automatic) |
| Debugging time | Hours per incident | Minutes |
| Customer support tickets | 200+ during failures | <5 |

> **Setup Note**: The blog setup leverages Tasker's existing `curl | sh` application generator pattern rather than creating a separate installation process. This ensures consistency with Tasker's established tooling and reduces maintenance overhead.

## 🧪 Try Different Scenarios

The example includes multiple test scenarios:

```bash
# Successful checkout
curl -X POST .../checkout -d '{"payment_info": {"token": "test_success_visa"}}'

# Payment failure (retryable)
curl -X POST .../checkout -d '{"payment_info": {"token": "test_timeout_gateway"}}'

# Payment failure (non-retryable) 
curl -X POST .../checkout -d '{"payment_info": {"token": "test_insufficient_funds"}}'

# Inventory conflict
curl -X POST .../checkout -d '{"cart_items": [{"product_id": 1, "quantity": 999}]}'
```

## 💡 Key Takeaways for Readers

1. **Break monoliths into atomic steps** - Single responsibility with clear boundaries
2. **Design for failure** - Assume every external call will fail sometimes  
3. **Make retries intelligent** - Different strategies for different error types
4. **Provide complete visibility** - You can't fix what you can't see
5. **Think workflows, not procedures** - Workflows can pause, retry, and resume
