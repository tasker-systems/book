# Chapter 1: E-commerce Checkout Reliability

> **The Story**: "It's Black Friday. Your checkout is failing 15% of the time. Credit cards are charged but orders aren't created. Customer support has 200 tickets and counting."

Transform a fragile, monolithic checkout flow into a bulletproof workflow engine using Tasker's reliability patterns.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This chapter introduces Tasker's foundational concepts through a scenario every e-commerce engineer recognizes:

- **Atomic workflow steps** that eliminate partial failures
- **Intelligent retry strategies** for different error types
- **Complete state management** and recovery capabilities
- **Built-in observability** for debugging and monitoring

## 🚀 Try It Now

Experience the transformation from fragile to reliable in 2 minutes:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tasker-systems/tasker/main/blog-examples/ecommerce-reliability/setup.sh | bash
```

This creates a complete working Rails application demonstrating:
- 5-step checkout workflow with dependencies
- Payment processing with retry logic
- Inventory management with race condition protection
- Email delivery with exponential backoff
- Complete failure recovery and visibility

## 📊 The Results

| Metric | Before Tasker | After Tasker |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Checkout failure rate** | 15% during peak | 0.2% |
| **Manual recovery time** | 6 hours | 0 (automatic) |
| **Debugging time** | Hours per incident | Minutes |
| **Customer support tickets** | 200+ during failures | <5 |

## 🏗️ What's Inside

### [The Complete Story](blog-post.md)
The full narrative from Black Friday nightmare to reliable checkout system, including:
- The monolithic checkout that failed
- Step-by-step Tasker transformation
- Real code examples with explanations
- Concrete results and business impact

### [Working Code Examples](code-examples/README.md)
Complete, production-ready implementations:
- **Task Handler**: Main checkout workflow coordination
- **Step Handlers**: Cart validation, payment processing, inventory updates, order creation, email confirmation
- **Models**: Product, Order, and supporting data structures
- **Demo Infrastructure**: Controllers, payment simulator, sample data
- **Configuration**: YAML workflow definitions with environment-specific settings

### [Comprehensive Testing Guide](TESTING.md)
Multiple testing scenarios to explore reliability features:
- **Success flows**: Normal checkout completion
- **Retryable failures**: Payment timeouts, service unavailability
- **Non-retryable failures**: Invalid cards, insufficient funds
- **Recovery scenarios**: Workflow restart from failure points
- **Load testing**: Concurrent checkout stress testing

### [Quick Setup Scripts](setup-scripts/README.md)
Multiple installation options:
- **One-line installer**: Uses Tasker's proven `curl | sh` pattern
- **Manual setup**: Step-by-step for exploration
- **Rails generator**: For integrating into existing projects

## 🧪 Key Examples

### Before: Fragile Monolithic Checkout
```ruby
def process_order(cart_items, payment_info, customer_info)
  validated_items = validate_cart_items(cart_items)
  totals = calculate_order_totals(validated_items)
  payment_result = PaymentProcessor.charge(amount: totals[:total], payment_method: payment_info)
  update_inventory_levels(validated_items)
  order = Order.create!(items: validated_items, total: totals[:total], payment_id: payment_result.id)
  OrderMailer.confirmation_email(order).deliver_now
  order
rescue => e
  # What do we do here? Payment might be charged...
  logger.error "Checkout failed: #{e.message}"
  raise
end
```

### After: Reliable Workflow Steps
```ruby
class OrderProcessingHandler < Tasker::TaskHandler::Base
  define_step_templates do |templates|
    templates.define(
      name: 'validate_cart',
      retryable: true,
      retry_limit: 3
    )
    templates.define(
      name: 'process_payment',
      depends_on_step: 'validate_cart',
      retryable: true,
      retry_limit: 3,
      timeout: 30.seconds
    )
    templates.define(
      name: 'create_order',
      depends_on_step: 'process_payment'
    )
    templates.define(
      name: 'send_confirmation',
      depends_on_step: 'create_order',
      retryable: true,
      retry_limit: 5
    )
  end
end
```

## 🔍 Deep Dive Topics

### Atomic Step Design
Each workflow step is independent and retryable:
- **Single responsibility**: One step, one purpose
- **Clear boundaries**: Defined inputs and outputs
- **State persistence**: Results saved for recovery
- **Idempotent operations**: Safe to retry

### Intelligent Retry Logic
Different strategies for different failure types:
- **Payment timeouts**: Exponential backoff with jitter
- **Inventory conflicts**: Linear retry with shorter delays
- **Email delivery**: High retry count with longer intervals
- **Invalid data**: Immediate failure, no retries

### Complete Observability
Built-in visibility into workflow execution:
- **Real-time status**: Current step and progress
- **Execution history**: Complete step-by-step timeline
- **Error context**: Detailed failure information
- **Performance metrics**: Duration and retry statistics

## 💡 Key Takeaways

1. **Break monoliths into atomic steps** - Single responsibility with clear boundaries
2. **Design for failure** - Assume every external call will fail sometimes
3. **Make retries intelligent** - Different strategies for different error types
4. **Provide complete visibility** - You can't fix what you can't see
5. **Think workflows, not procedures** - Workflows can pause, retry, and resume

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] **Identify workflow opportunities** in your own systems
- [ ] **Design atomic, retryable steps** for complex processes
- [ ] **Implement intelligent retry strategies** based on error types
