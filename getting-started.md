# Getting Started

Welcome to **Tasker: Real-World Engineering Stories** – a practical guide to workflow orchestration through compelling engineering narratives.

## 🎯 What This Series Covers

Every chapter in this series follows a proven formula:

1. **The Problem**: A relatable engineering nightmare (3 AM alerts, Black Friday failures)
2. **Why It Matters**: Technical deep-dive into what goes wrong and why
3. **The Solution**: Step-by-step Tasker implementation
4. **The Results**: Concrete metrics showing the improvement
5. **Try It Yourself**: Complete, runnable code you can test immediately

## 🚀 Quick Demo

Want to see Tasker in action right away? Try our e-commerce reliability example:

```bash
# One command setup - complete working demo
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tasker-systems/tasker/main/blog-examples/ecommerce-reliability/setup.sh | bash

# Start the services
cd ecommerce-blog-demo
redis-server &
bundle exec sidekiq &
bundle exec rails server

# Test a reliable checkout workflow
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/checkout \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"checkout": {"cart_items": [{"product_id": 1, "quantity": 2}], "payment_info": {"token": "test_success_visa", "amount": 100.00}, "customer_info": {"email": "test@example.com", "name": "Test Customer"}}}'
```

## 📚 How to Use This Guide

### For Readers New to Workflow Orchestration

Start with **Chapter 1: E-commerce Checkout Reliability**. It introduces all the foundational concepts through a scenario every developer recognizes.

### For Experienced Engineers

You can jump to any chapter that matches your current challenges:

- **Reliability problems?** → Chapter 1 (E-commerce) or Chapter 2 (Data Pipelines)
- **Service coordination issues?** → Chapter 3 (Microservices)
- **Team scaling challenges?** → Chapter 4 (Organization)
- **Debugging difficulties?** → Chapter 5 (Observability)
- **Compliance requirements?** → Chapter 6 (Security)

### For Engineering Leaders

Each chapter includes business impact metrics and team productivity improvements that demonstrate ROI.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

### System Requirements

- **Ruby 3.0+** and **Rails 7.0+**
- **PostgreSQL** (required for Tasker's SQL functions)
- **Redis** (for background job processing)
- **Git** (for downloading examples)

### Quick Environment Check

```bash
# Verify your environment
ruby -v    # Should show 3.0+
rails -v   # Should show 7.0+
psql --version
redis-server --version
```

### Installing Tasker

Each chapter example uses Tasker's one-line installer, but you can also add it to existing projects:

```ruby
# In your Gemfile
gem 'tasker', '~> 2.5.0'

# Then run
bundle install
bundle exec rails tasker:install:migrations
bundle exec rails tasker:install:database_objects
bundle exec rails db:migrate
```

## 🎭 The Stories Behind the Code

These aren't abstract examples. Every scenario is based on real engineering challenges:

- **Black Friday checkout failures** that cost $50K/hour
- **3 AM data pipeline alerts** that ruin everyone's sleep
- **Microservices coordination** that turns simple operations into chaos
- **Team scaling pains** where workflows conflict and block each other
- **Production debugging** where you can't see what's happening
- **Enterprise compliance** that turns simple workflows into security nightmares

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this series, you'll be able to:

### Technical Skills
- Design atomic, retryable workflow steps
- Implement intelligent retry strategies for different failure types
- Build complete observability into workflow execution
- Handle complex dependencies and parallel operations
- Organize workflows with namespaces and versioning
- Secure workflows for enterprise environments

### Engineering Judgment
- Recognize when processes need workflow orchestration
- Choose appropriate retry and recovery strategies
- Balance reliability with complexity
- Design for observability from the beginning
- Plan for team scaling challenges

### Business Impact
- Reduce manual intervention in critical processes
- Improve system reliability and uptime
- Accelerate debugging and incident resolution
- Enable confident deployment of complex features
- Meet compliance and audit requirements

## 💡 Tips for Maximum Learning

### 1. Run Every Example

Don't just read the code – run it. Each example is designed to work immediately and demonstrate the concepts in action.

### 2. Break Things Intentionally

Try the failure scenarios in each testing guide. Understanding how things fail helps you design better recovery strategies.

### 3. Adapt to Your Context

The examples are starting points. Think about how these patterns apply to your specific engineering challenges.

### 4. Share Your Stories

Every engineer has workflow horror stories. Share yours in the discussions – they might become the next chapter!

## 🆘 Getting Help

### If Examples Don't Work

1. Check the **troubleshooting guide** in each chapter
2. Verify your environment meets the prerequisites
3. Try the example in a clean environment
4. Check the GitHub issues for known problems

### If You Want to Go Deeper
