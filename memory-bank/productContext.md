# Product Context: Engineering Stories That Teach

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Traditional technical documentation for workflow orchestration tools suffers from several critical issues:
- **Abstract Examples**: Generic "foo/bar" examples that don't reflect real-world complexity
- **Context Switching**: Developers must piece together concepts from multiple disconnected sources
- **Setup Friction**: Complex installation processes that prevent immediate experimentation
- **Theory-Practice Gap**: Conceptual explanations without practical implementation guidance

### The Solution
This GitBook transforms workflow orchestration education through:
- **Relatable Narratives**: Every chapter starts with an engineering scenario developers have lived through
- **Complete Examples**: Full working implementations that demonstrate real-world patterns
- **Instant Gratification**: One-command setup that gets developers experimenting immediately
- **Progressive Learning**: Each chapter builds on previous concepts naturally

## How It Should Work
