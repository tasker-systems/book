# Project Brief: Tasker Engineering Stories GitBook

## Project Overview

This is a GitBook documentation project that presents the Tasker Rails workflow orchestration engine through compelling engineering stories. The project transforms technical documentation into narrative-driven content that helps developers understand workflow orchestration through relatable scenarios.

## Core Mission

**Transform complex workflow orchestration concepts into accessible, actionable knowledge through engineering stories that every developer can relate to.**

## Primary Goals

### 1. Educational Impact
- Make workflow orchestration concepts accessible to all skill levels
- Provide complete, runnable examples for immediate hands-on learning
- Bridge the gap between theory and practical implementation

### 2. Developer Experience
- Offer one-command setup for all examples
- Ensure all code examples work immediately
- Provide comprehensive troubleshooting and testing guides

### 3. Business Value
- Demonstrate clear ROI through reliability improvements
- Show concrete metrics and business impact
- Target engineering leaders and technical decision makers

## Target Audience

### Primary
- **Software Engineers**: Individual contributors building workflows
- **Engineering Leaders**: Team leads and engineering managers
- **Technical Product Managers**: Product leaders overseeing technical workflows

### Secondary
- **DevOps Engineers**: Infrastructure and reliability focus
- **Data Engineers**: ETL and data pipeline workflows
- **Enterprise Architects**: Large-scale system design

## Content Strategy

### Narrative Structure
- Each chapter follows a problem → solution → results format
- Stories build on each other with character and technical continuity
- Real-world scenarios that developers recognize immediately

### Technical Depth
- Complete working code for every example
- Progressive complexity from basic to enterprise patterns
- Integration with production tools and monitoring

## Success Metrics

### Engagement
- Time spent reading chapters
- Code example download/execution rates
- Community discussions and questions

### Educational Impact
- Tasker adoption rates
- Community contributions to examples
- Developer success stories

## Repository Exclusions

**Important**: This repository contains development tools (`.cursor/` directory and `memory-bank/` directory) that should NOT be published to GitBook. These are development aids for maintaining the project but are not part of the public documentation.
