# Engineering Stories

A progressive-disclosure blog series that teaches Tasker concepts through real-world scenarios. Each story builds on the previous, showing how a growing engineering team adopts workflow orchestration across all four supported languages.

> These stories are being rewritten for the current Tasker architecture.
> See the [archive](../../archive/blog/) for the original GitBook-era versions.
