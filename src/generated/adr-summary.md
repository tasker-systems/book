This page summarizes the Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) from the Tasker project.
Each ADR documents a significant design decision, its context, and consequences.

| # | Title | Status | Summary |
|---|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | [Actor-Based Orchestration Architecture](../decisions/adr-001-actor-pattern.md) | Accepted | The decision was made to switch from a command pattern with direct service delegation to a lightweight actor-based architecture due to testing complexity and unclear boundaries between components. ... |
| 2 | [Bounded MPSC Channel Migration](../decisions/adr-002-bounded-mpsc-channels.md) | Accepted | The decision was made to migrate the tasker-core system from its current inconsistent and risky usage of Multi-Producer Single-Consumer (MPSC) channels to a uniform implementation that uses only bo... |
| 3 | [Processor UUID Ownership Removal](../decisions/adr-003-ownership-removal.md) | Accepted | The architectural decision was made to remove processor UUID ownership enforcement in the state transitions of orchestrators, as it prevented new orchestrators from taking over tasks when an old on... |
| 4 | [Backoff Logic Consolidation](../decisions/adr-004-backoff-consolidation.md) | Accepted | To address multiple conflicting implementations of exponential backoff logic in the tasker-core system, which caused significant issues, we decided to consolidate the backoff logic into a single, u... |
| 5 | [Worker Dual-Channel Event System](../decisions/adr-005-dual-event-system.md) | Accepted | The architectural decision was made to replace the original blocking `.call()` pattern in Rust workers with a dual-channel command pattern to enable true concurrency and prevent race conditions, en... |
| 6 | [Worker Actor-Service Decomposition](../decisions/adr-006-worker-decomposition.md) | Accepted | The decision was made to decompose the monolithic `WorkerProcessor` in the tasker-worker crate into an actor-based design due to its difficulty in testing and inconsistency with existing architectu... |
| 7 | [FFI Over WASM for Language Workers](../decisions/adr-007-ffi-over-wasm.md) | Accepted | The team decided to proceed with FFI for the TypeScript worker implementation, matching the successful Ruby and Python worker approaches, due to its pattern consistency and production readiness. WA... |
| 8 | [Handler Composition Pattern](../decisions/adr-008-composition-pattern.md) | u | The architectural decision was made to migrate all handler patterns in the system to use composition via mixins, aligning with the Batchable handlers' implementation, to adhere to the principle of ... |
