# Build Your First Project

This section walks you from zero to a running Tasker workflow. Choose your path based on how you like to learn:

## Quick Start

**[Quick Start](quick-start.md)** — Two ways to get running fast:

- **Path A: Clone an example app** (5 min) — Docker Compose up, pick a framework, curl an endpoint
- **Path B: Bootstrap with tasker-ctl** (10 min) — Initialize a project, generate handlers, configure, and run

## Step-by-Step Guides

If you prefer a guided walkthrough:

1. **[Installation](install.md)** — Install language packages and run Tasker infrastructure
2. **[Using tasker-ctl](tasker-ctl.md)** — Initialize projects, generate handlers from templates, manage configuration
3. **[Your First Handler](first-handler.md)** — Write a step handler in your preferred language
4. **[Your First Workflow](first-workflow.md)** — Define a task template, submit a task, watch it execute

## Language Guides

Comprehensive setup and API reference for each supported language:

- **[Ruby](ruby.md)** — Ruby workers with `tasker-rb`
- **[Python](python.md)** — Python workers with `tasker-py`
- **[TypeScript](typescript.md)** — TypeScript workers with `@tasker-systems/tasker`
- **[Rust](rust.md)** — Native Rust workers with `tasker-worker`

## What's Next

After building your first project, see **[Next Steps](next-steps.md)** for where to go from here — example apps, engineering stories, architecture deep-dives, and production operations.
