# Next Steps

You've built your first handler and workflow. Here's where to go from here.

## See Complete Applications

The [Example Apps](../getting-started/example-apps.md) demonstrate five real-world workflow patterns implemented in all four languages. Each app is a fully working project you can clone, run, and study.

## Learn Through Stories

The [Engineering Stories](../stories/README.md) series teaches Tasker concepts through progressive scenarios — from a simple e-commerce checkout to multi-team namespace isolation. Each story builds on the previous one.
